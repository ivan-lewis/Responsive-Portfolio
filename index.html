        <p>My name is Ivan Lewis. I grew up an hour West of Tucson. I currently live in Tucson and enjoy the city very.
            <br> My interest in coding began with me making very
            <strong>very</strong> basic html websites for fun. The level of expertise what probably to the extent of our Fan Page
            assignment.
            <br> I started using codes for Microsoft Access databases. This is where I began to really see the beneifts of coding.
            I then tweaked a few websites by studying the code and changing areas to see what effect that would cause.</p>
